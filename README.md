# FLOAT Continuity System

A schema-driven UI system for healthcare continuity management, built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## Overview

The FLOAT Continuity System is designed around the philosophy that "form fields are moments of care" - touchpoints where practitioners interact with patients through technology. The system emphasizes **integration over conquest** and follows a **"shacks not cathedrals"** approach, building modular, focused, and adaptable components.

## Core Features

### üîç Log Entry Viewer
- Dark-themed viewer for various log entries (bridges, threads, concepts)
- Tabbed navigation for content organization
- Thread-based filtering and navigation
- Previous/next entry navigation with keyboard shortcuts

### üéõÔ∏è Schema-Driven UI System
- Dynamic UI generation based on JSON schemas
- Support for multiple field types (text, number, select, boolean, badges, etc.)
- Real-time schema editing and preview
- Pre-built schema examples for common use cases

### üß≠ Intelligent Navigation
- Breadcrumb navigation with proper hierarchy
- Direct entry access via URL parameters
- Thread-specific views and filtering
- Consistent routing patterns across the application

### üì± Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible sidebar
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Consistent design system with dark theme
- Accessible color contrast and keyboard navigation

## Key Concepts

### Form Fields as Moments of Care
Every form field in the system is designed as a cognitive interface - a moment where care can be delivered. This philosophy drives the schema-driven approach, allowing dynamic reconfiguration based on context.

### Integration vs. Conquest
The system supports existing workflows rather than forcing rigid processes. By separating schema (data/structure) from presentation (UI components), we enable flexible adaptation to different contexts.

### Shacks not Cathedrals
Components are built to be modular, focused, and adaptable. Each piece serves a specific purpose and can be easily modified or replaced without affecting the entire system.

## Schema-Driven UI

The system uses JSON schemas to define UI components dynamically:

```typescript
const patientFormSchema: UISchema = {
  id: "patient-form",
  title: "Patient Information",
  fields: [
    {
      id: "name",
      type: "text",
      label: "Full Name",
      required: true
    },
    {
      id: "age",
      type: "number",
      label: "Age"
    }
  ]
};
```

Supported field types:
- `text` - Text input fields
- `number` - Numeric input fields
- `select` - Dropdown selections
- `boolean` - Yes/No toggles
- `badge` - Display badges
- `heading` - Section headings
- `paragraph` - Text content
- `separator` - Visual separators

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom state management
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Development

### Code Organization
- Components follow single responsibility principle
- Custom hooks encapsulate complex state logic
- Types are centralized in dedicated files
- Consistent naming conventions throughout

### State Management
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Custom hooks for complex business logic
- Context providers for widely shared state
- React Query for server state management

### Styling
- Utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Consistent color palette and spacing
- Dark theme with purple/pink accents
- Responsive design patterns

## API Integration

The system is designed to work with RESTful APIs and supports:
- Real-time data fetching with React Query
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Error handling and retry logic
- Background data synchronization

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI interactions
- Integration tests for user workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths

## Deployment

### Using Lovable
