# Implementation Plan for FLOAT Continuity System

## Overview
This implementation plan integrates the findings from our code audit with existing and future features for the FLOAT Continuity System. Each section includes checkboxes for tracking completion and prompts for using Lovable for code review and changelog generation.

## 1. Data Management Refactoring

## 4. Navigation and Routing Refinement
- [ ] Create proper route definitions file
- [ ] Implement consistent navigation pattern across app
- [ ] Add route parameters for direct entry access
- [ ] Implement proper history management
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation

**Code Review**: Use Lovable to review routing and navigation implementation.
**Changelog Entry**: "Refined navigation system with consistent routing patterns and history management."

## 5. UI/UX Consistency Improvements
- [ ] Create design token system for colors, spacing, etc.
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness across all components
- [ ] Standardize form handling patterns

**Code Review**: Use Lovable to review UI/UX consistency and accessibility.
**Changelog Entry**: "Improved UI/UX consistency with better design tokens and accessibility."

## 6. Code Quality and Maintenance
- [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all components and functions
- [ ] Remove unused code and imports
- [ ] Optimize performance with memoization where appropriate
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries

**Code Review**: Use Lovable to review code quality improvements.
**Changelog Entry**: "Enhanced code quality with better documentation and performance optimizations."

## 7. Schema System Enhancements
- [ ] Refactor schema renderer for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Implement schema validation with Zod
- [ ] Add more field types to schema system
- [ ] Create schema version control mechanism
- [ ] Improve schema editor usability

**Code Review**: Use Lovable to review schema system enhancements.
**Changelog Entry**: "Enhanced schema system with validation and expanded field types."

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add component tests for key UI elements
- [ ] Create integration tests for main user flows

- [ ] Add visualization for thread relationships
- [ ] Implement temporal awareness features (from RFC)

**Planning Review**: Use Lovable to review feature implementation and prioritization.
**Changelog Entry**: "Implemented key features including data persistence, search, and temporal awareness."

## Layered Architecture Implementation
- [ ] Create proper services layer for data operations
- [ ] Implement repositories pattern for data access
- [ ] Add facade pattern for complex subsystems
- [ ] Separate presentation, business logic, and data access
- [ ] Create proper dependency injection system

**Code Review**: Use Lovable to review architectural implementation.
